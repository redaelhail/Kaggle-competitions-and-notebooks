### [1. Generate spectrograms with a Neural network:](https://github.com/redaelhail/Kaggle-competitions-and-notebooks/blob/main/Generating_spectrograms_with_neural_networks.ipynb)

 Since Fast Fourier Transform is a linear function applied on any signals, it can be easy to train a dense neural network on mimicking FFTs. This was proved in this notebook and the neural network were highly capable of generating spectrograms that are  very similar to spectrograms generated by FFT.
 
 ### [2. Data visualization with Plotly, Seaborn and Wordcloud on US cars dataset:](https://github.com/redaelhail/Kaggle-competitions-and-notebooks/blob/main/data-visualization-plotly-seaborn-and-wordcloud.ipynb)
 Notebook to show different ways to explore data by using advanced data visualition libraries.
