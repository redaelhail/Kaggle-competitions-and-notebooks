- Generate spectrograms with a Neural network: Since Fast Fourier Transform is a linear function applied on any signals, it can be easy to train a dense neural network on mimicking FFTs. This was proved in this notebook and the neural network were highly capable of generating spectrograms that are  very similar to spectrograms generated by FFT.
